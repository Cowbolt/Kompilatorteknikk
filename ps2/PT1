1.
New rule set

S -> c s a n O

O -> E O | Ãª

E -> b | v |p

This solves the ambiguity of which expansion to take when reaching L by expanding whenever the string is unfinished.
U is superfluous,so we remove it.

2.

FIRST(S): {c}
FIRST(O): {b, v, p}
FIRST(E): {b, v, p}
nullable(O): yes, only nullable nonterminal.

FOLLOW(S): {$}
FOLLOW(O): {$}, O always expands E to its left.
FOLLOW(E): {b, v, p}.
